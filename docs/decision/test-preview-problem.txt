# Problem
    Test class was created to store data for Tests. This class contains lots of data,
such as questions and answer. When querying for test preview page (e.g. show 10 test),
we need only description, name, date and author - not questions. In this case,
instantiating all info for this objects can be too slow.

# Solutions:
    1) Still use Test class, but not fill in with all info.
        Breaks down the encapsulation, these instances became not full. It would be hard to
        test and can course problems.
    2) Load ap all info into Test - this can be too slow, but encapsulation remains.
    3) Make another TestPreview class.

# Taken solution:
    3) It has more code, but the solution is more clear and solve
