UserDAO works with username, password and role.
QuizDAO works with quizID, username and quiz data.

In Postgres table username in addition has users.id field.
Table quizzes has an owner_id field (references users.id field).

# Problem
    How to organize mapping user_id <-> username?
    Moving it to UserDAO will result in "realization comes through interface"
problem, because UserDAO originally don't know about users_id.
    Moving it into UserDAOPostgres as non-override method will result in
QuizPostgresDAO depends on realization UserDAOPostgres, so it will be difficult
to move users into other db (say Mongo) if needed.
    Moving in to QuizDAOPostgres will lead to the same problem.
